<p style="text-align:justify">Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) offers a cost-effective solution to link blockage problem in mmWave communications, and the prerequisite of which is the accurate estimation of (1) the optimal beams for base station/access point (BS/AP) and mobile terminal (MT), (2) the optimal reflection patterns for IRSs, and (3) link blockage. In this work, we carry out beam training designs for IRSs assisted mmWave communications to estimate the aforementioned parameters. To acquire the optimal beams and reflection patterns, we firstly perform random beamforming and maximum likelihood estimation to estimate angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) of the line of sight (LoS) path between BS/AP (or IRSs) and MT. Then, with the estimated AoDs, we propose an iterative positioning algorithm that achieves centimeter-level positioning accuracy. The obtained location information is not only a fringe benefit but also enables us to cross verify and enhance the estimation of AoA and AoD, and it also facilitates the estimation of blockage indicator. Numerical results show the superiority of our proposed beam training scheme and verify the performance gain brought by location information.</p>
