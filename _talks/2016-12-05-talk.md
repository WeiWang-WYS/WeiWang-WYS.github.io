<p style="text-align:justify">Antenna switch enables multiple antennas to share a common RF chain. It also offers an additional spatial dimension, i.e., antenna index, that can be utilized for data transmission via both signal space and spatial dimension. In this work, we propose a Huffman coding-based adaptive spatial modulation that generalizes both conventional spatial modulation and transmit antenna selection. Through the Huffman coding, i.e., designing variable length prefix codes, the transmit antennas can be activated with different probabilities. When the input signal is Gaussian distributed, the optimal antenna activation probability is derived through optimizing channel capacity. To make the optimization tractable, closed form upper bound and lower bound are derived as the effective approximations of channel capacity. When the input is discrete QAM signal, the optimal antenna activation probability is derived through minimizing symbol error rate. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive transmission offers considerable performance improvement over the conventional spatial modulation and transmit antenna selection.</p>
