<p style="text-align:justify">In this work, we study the max-min Euclidean distance-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmit codebook design with channel state information at transmitter. Different from existing max-min precoder designs, a shaping-based codebook design method is proposed to construct the codebook from a structured signal lattice. Hyperrectangle shaping is found to be superior to the shaping region of the precoder-based design in terms of power efficiency. Based on the proposed hyper-rectangle shaping region, the number of available spatial dimensions used for codebook construction is first determined through maximizing the approximated constellation figure of merit. Then, the codebook is derived by lattice precoding and shifting the unshaped latticed points inside the hyperrectangle region. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed shaping-based codebook is strictly better than present precoder-based codebook designs and is more robust under different MIMO channel conditions.</p>
